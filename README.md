## 🖥️ Streamlit App Usage

### Features:
- Input `Time`, `Amount`, `V1–V28` manually
- Choose prediction model:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Deep Learning (Keras)
  - DBSCAN (Unsupervised)
- Output: **Fraudulent** 🚨 or **Legitimate** ✅

### Run Locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
🧠 Training & Model Saving
Trained models and scalers are saved using:

python
```bash
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'model_name.pkl')
model = joblib.load('model_name.pkl')
Deep learning model:
```
python
```bash
model.save("fraud_dl_model.keras")
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("fraud_dl_model.keras")
```

Random Forest and XGBoost performed robustly.

Made with ❤️ By Kunal

Deep learning gave strong recall but needs careful tuning.

DBSCAN successfully flagged outliers (unsupervised fraud detection).
